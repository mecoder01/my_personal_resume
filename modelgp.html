<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>Web development is the activity to develop a website or web based application. Different browser like firefox, googlechrome, safari, internet explorer, etc are the web browser where we can rub web application and accesible through website. Web pages are meant to be share the information in every corner of the world and to communicate with everyone. To develop the webpages Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the commonly used language. So as our first term assignment was creating a personal webpages which includes their own personal information and some experiences and other bio as well. So this can be done with the six different pages where first pages to create landing pages or home pages. Similarly about me, cv, social, contact are created in html file for the webpages. This code should be made live by pushing it into github. </p>
